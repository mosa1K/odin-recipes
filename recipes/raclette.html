        <ol>
            <li>If necessary, cut the raclette cheese to fit the coupelles or small trays under the raclette grill.</li>
            <li>Turn the raclette grill on to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>If you are using bacon, place the bacon rashers onto the grill plate and cook until your liking.</li>
            <li>Use the bacon fat to cook the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you are not using bacon, simply brush the grill plate with some oil.</li>
            <li>Place some meat and vegetables on the hot grill plate.</li>
            <li>While the meat and vegetables are cooking on the grill plate, place a slice of raclette cheese into the coupelles or small trays, and place them under the heating element.</li>
            <li>The melted raclette cheese is usually served over the warm potatoes on your plate, which you should slice just before adding the cheese. But it is also common to place the melted cheese over the cooked vegetables. Some people even put slices of potatoes into the coupelles so that the cheese melts directly on top.  Do as you please!</li>
            <li>Be careful to not overcook the meat on the grill plate.</li>
