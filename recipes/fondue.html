    <h3>This Cheese Fondue with grilled bread is such a fun, quick, and easy appetizer to make on the grill this Summer!</h3>
</p>

<p>This cheese fondue recipe is always so good! I've been making it exactly like this since the early '70s. I like to serve it with cubes of French bread for dipping, but baby potatoes, bell peppers, and sliced apples also work great!</p>
